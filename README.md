# How to use this code
Step 1: Download the original dataset used in Laouénan &amp; Rathelot (2022) at https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20190188
Step 2: Download and run the R script in this repository (Replication.R)

# Note 
- Since the dataset is large, it is recommended to run each replication code separately to avoid long waiting time
- Expect at least 5 hours to complete running all the code, the total time might vary across machines
